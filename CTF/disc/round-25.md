# cos1

> Points: 30 | Category: Misc | Author: Eth007

What is the cosine of 42 radians, rounded to 6 decimal places? Submit your answer wrapped in `ictf{}`.

---

1. import `cos` method from math module
2. use built in `round()` method to round result to 6 decimal places

```py
>>> from math import cos
>>> round(cos(42), 6)
-0.399985
```

Something went wrong here...

- https://imaginaryctf.org/f/CJVKB#flag.txt

---

After initially cat-ing out the file, it looked like the characters got scrambled. I decided to take a closer look by opening the file up in vim

![flag.txt in vim](https://i.imgur.com/SaBsFKK.png)

There's special unicode characters that are scrambling the text and overall making it behave weirdly. In order to get the flag, we need to ignore these. I used the `-o` option in grep to only print out the matching parts (rather than the whole line) of the specified pattern, which in this case is a set of alphanumeric characters. Each match will be printed on a new line, so in order to get it all on one, I piped the result to the `tr` command and removed the newline characters. The full command is shown below.

```sh
$ grep -aio "[A-Za-z0-9_\-\{\}]" flag.txt | tr -d "\n"
```

We get the flag

# cos2

> Points: 30 | Category: Misc | Author: Eth007

What is the cosine of 42 radians, rounded to 100 decimal places? Wrap your flag in `ictf{}`

---

We can't follow the same process as the `cos1` challenge, because 100 decimal places is way too much to be accurately rounded via `round()`. I ended up using sympy's `evalf()` method

```py
>>> from sympy import cos
>>> cos(42).evalf(100)
-0.3999853149883512939547073371772020283804228791424190606167446601513424425835587794388549191368621883
```

# Enormous

> Points: 50 | Category: Crypto | Author: puzzler7

I hear that more bits of security is better, so I'm using MASSIVE primes, and a TON of them! I bet you can't recover my flag now...

- https://imaginaryctf.org/f/kjJkR#out.txt

Looking at the RSA implementation in the provided `enc.py` file, we can see that `n` is a huge number (10124 bits to be exact), and `e` is only 31. At first, I thought `m` would be small enough so that $m^{e} < n$. If this were the case, we could get the plaintext by taking the `e`th root of the ciphertext. Unfortunately, after giving this idea a shot, it did not return the flag, so we know that $m^{e} > n$. Because it didn't seem like the flag was padded, $m^{e}$ was most likely *barely* bigger than `n`.

> Moving forward, we're going to use the fact that a modular congruence in the form $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ can be rewritten as $a - b = kn$ for some integer k.

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes
from sympy import integer_nthroot

with open("out.txt") as f:
    n = int(f.readline().rstrip().split("= ")[1])
    c = int(f.readline().rstrip().split("= ")[1])
    e = 31

for k in range(-1000, 0):
    m, isroot = integer_nthroot(c - n*k, e)
    if isroot:
        print(f"{k=}")
        print(long_to_bytes(m))
        break
```

$c_{1} \equiv m^{e_{1}} \pmod{n}$  
$c_{2} \equiv m^{e_{2}} \pmod{n}$  

*BÃ©zout's identity*: if $gcd(e_{1}, e_{2}) = 1$ then
$\exists(a,b) \in \mathbb{Z} : a\*e_{1} + b\*e_{2} = 1$

We can find `a` and `b` by using the extended euclidean algorithm. Once we get those two values, we can get `m`

$m \equiv (c_{1}^a * c_{2}^b) \pmod{n}$

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes

with open("output.txt") as f:
    n, c1, c2 = [ int(num.rstrip()) for num in f.readlines() ]

def extended_gcd(a, b):
    if a == 0:
        return b, 0, 1
    gcd, x, y = extended_gcd(b%a, a)
    return gcd, y-(b//a)*x, x

_, a, b = extended_gcd(e1, e2)
m = pow(c1,a,n) * pow(c2,b,n) % n
print(long_to_bytes(m))
